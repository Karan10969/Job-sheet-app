To run the App locally: 

# Open the app in VS Code
# Change the Directory with command on the terminal < cd job-sheet-app >
# Start the JSON-Server with command < json-server data/db.json --port 8000 >
# !! use a different terminal for this command < cd job-sheet-app >
# Then start the Frontend localhost server with command < npm start > 


About: 
- This app uses JSON server and the data is kept on the local machine
- If you prefer a database connection, I can use the Node.js for server and MongoDB for database
- But with JSON server the app is fully functional
